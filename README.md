**Sonar Rock VS Mine Prediction using Machine Learing**

**Problem Statement** : In a war situation , two countries are fighting against each other in ocean. Both the countries have mounted Mines inside the ocean so as to prevent other country from invading into their territory by exloading mines as soon as they are above it. Sonar is a equipment which is used to find objects under water using sound waves. There will both rocks and mines be present inside the ocean and the Radar wants to distinquish between both of them. So constructing a machine learning model to predict whether the object detected by sonar is mine or rock.

In the above image, a sonar equipment can be seen inside the oscean and mine is mounted at the bottom of sea with rock.
